**Web Speech API Demo**

The Web Speech API enables web apps to handle voice data. This Demo, consists of two parts. To the left side, is the **Speech recognition** part; on the right side is the **Speech synthesis** part. These two components are part of the **Web Speech API**.
The **SpeechRecognition** interface provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio source and allows your app to respond appropriately. In this Demo, I dynamically edit **styles** by updating the background color property and display a random quote in the output part of the left side component of the demo.
The **Speechsynthesis** interface allows programs to read out their text content. In this Demo, the user provide a text to read, select a voice option from the dropdown menu, then click the **Speak** button to read the utterance. I have also included the **Pause/Resume** and **clear** options to pause or cancel the current utterance at anytime. For the best experience, please clear the utterance before adding a new text.
